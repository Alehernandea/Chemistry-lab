<H1> Introduction</H1>
<font size=6>
This website explains what we did in our chemistry lab with the “Red Cabbage pH Indicator Experiment.” We used juice from red cabbage as a natural way to test if everyday liquids are acidic, neutral, or basic. Red cabbage has a pigment called anthocyanin that changes color depending on how acidic or basic something is. Because of this, we can see the pH of a substance just by looking at the color change. The main goal of the experiment was to watch how the colors changed and match them to the pH level of each substance we tested.

<H1> Hypothesis</H1>
<font size=6>
We thought that adding red cabbage juice to different substances would make them change into a range of colors, depending on their pH levels. These color changes would help us easily tell if each substance was acidic, neutral, or basic, and give us a better understanding of how pH works.
